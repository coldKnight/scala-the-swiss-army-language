| \*\gI'm sure you did the prerequisites, but...

For that person who definitely isn't you that didn't install scala before coming:
Go to \chttp://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html\s and follow the instructions

- Mac?
> \ybrew install sbt \sor \yport install sbt

- Windows?
> Get the native \y.msi installer

- Linux?
> Repos available for \yaptitude\s and \yyum\s

- Manual?
> Download the \y.zip\s and execute \ybin/sbt\s or \ybin/sbt.sh\s
---
| \*\gDoes it work?

1) type \ysbt console\s at your terminal (or \ybin/sbt console\s if manually installed)
2) type \yscala\s at your terminal

If you see something like the following, you're in business!


\!Welcome to Scala 2.11.8 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.8.0_74).\s\k|
\!Type in expressions for evaluation. Or try :help.                          \s\k|
\!                                                                           \s\k|
\!scala>                                                                     \s\k|

For those of you who haven't gotten it working, check out

| \*\gNow that that's out of the way


\cLet's talk about this talk:

- Explore Scala, not libraries

- No demo website, no sample game

- Hours of hands-on Scala experience

- Get you comfortable with the patterns of "idiomatic" Scala


\rCaveats:

- 3 hours of typing
---
| \*\gWhy Scala?


--
- \yFamiliarity:
  You \*could\s write Scala much like Java, but that would be a waste

--
- \yCrazy-powerful collections API

--
- \yBetter types
  Less defensive programming

--
- \yFunctional programming
  Less state = happier brains
